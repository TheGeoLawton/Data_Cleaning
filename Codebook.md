##Clean Data

This is the cleaned and tidied raw dataset. Each row represents an observation of fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap from the original study. Only means and standard deviations are included, as defined by a variable ending in mean() or std(). A more detailed description of individual variables is available in features_info.txt.

##Output Summary

This is a processed version of the cleaned data. For each subject and activity, the mean is computed.
